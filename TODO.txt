1. Try to convert the server code into a class (maybe with boost)
2. Try to get response from linux team about interface we sent them.
3. Try to get response from web server team (the progress with their webserver for authentication)
4. Establish coding structure for Client class.
5. Figure out ways to tag the information the client sent to the server so the server knows what to do with it.
